# Emergency evacuation route planning using Breadth first search
This project addresses the effective emergency route planning in closed layouts, considering static impediments within buildings that impact evacuation time. By utilizing the Breadth-First Search (BFS) traversal algorithm on a 3D matrix obtained from preprocessing Building Information Modeling (BIM) data, the study aims to efficiently identify the shortest path from any location within the building to the nearest exit gate enhancing building safety and emergency preparedness.
